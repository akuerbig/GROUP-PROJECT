    "The `players.csv` dataset contains all the individuals who have taken part in the **(PLAI)** research study, which aims to collect data about how people play video games. There are 196 observations within the dataset, and the variables for the given dataset are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `experience`: How a given player rates/describes their experience level\n",
    "* `subscribe`: Uncertain\n",
    "* `hashedEmail`: Player Email\n",
    "* `played_hours`: Total Hours Played\n",
    "* `name`\n",
    "* `gender`\n",
    "* `age`\n",
    "* `individualId`: Unique Player ID (left NaN)\n",
    "* `organizationName`: Player Organization (left NaN)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Our Question: Can we predict the total hours a player will partake in the study based on their age and/or their experience level?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response Variable:** `played_hours`\n",
    "**Predictor Variables:** `experience` `age`\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering this question will give the research group a clear idea of what type of demographic may be able to contribute the most to their study. For example, the results of the question may find a player with X type of experience contributes far more than those with Y type of experience, or that a player with Z type of experience actually rarely contributes at all. The key variables to help us answer this question are `age`, `experience`, and `played_hours` in `players.csv`. "
